# webscraping-with-python is a of web scraping tutorial. 
I follow Dataquest tutorial on web scraping with python to realize this project. 
The notebook is realised to help biginners with one more example.
I essentially use Beautifulsoup4 to parse the html files I got from the request done to the website of Bestbuy.
It was an exercise I did to select a computer for my personnal data science project.
I just make preliminary data exploration of data of computer at bestbuy at this period. I then collected data on computer on this site et then conclude with few visualizations.

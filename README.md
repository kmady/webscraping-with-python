# webscraping-with-python is a kind of web scraping tutorial. 
I follow Dataquest tutorial on web scraping with python to realize this project. 
The note book is realised to help biginners with one more example.
I essentially use Beautifulsoup to parse the html file I got from the website of Bestbuy.
It was an exercise I did to select a computer for my personnal data science project.
I just make preliminary data exploration of data of computer at bestbuy at this period.
